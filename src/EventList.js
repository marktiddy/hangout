          "<p>For those who haven't been before, this quiz is about film, music and TV. It can vary in toughness from month to month. It cost Â£2 a head, all money goes to charity and we always have one, sometimes two tables to the left of the bar where you come in. The Quiz starts at 8 but I would recommend most people to get there earlier if you can. The Meetup will start at 7.30. We also only have a 20 person limit to this event so in the event of a waiting list, please change your RSVP if you can't make it! This event is always on the first Monday of every Month.</p> ",
